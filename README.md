# Web Library Manager

A tiny client-side Library Management web app. Books are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

Files
- `index.html`
- `css/style.css`
- `js/app.js`

Open locally: double-click `index.html` or serve with a static server.

Notes
- This app is intentionally tiny and stores data in the browser.
- To export data, you can copy localStorage or extend the app to download JSON.
